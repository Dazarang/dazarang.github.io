            <h1>Terms of Use</h1>

            <p><strong>Last Updated: April 6, 2025</strong></p>

            <p>Welcome to TaskStack. Please read these Terms of Use carefully before using our application.</p>

            <p>By downloading, installing, or using the TaskStack application, you agree to be bound by these Terms of
                Use. If you do not agree with any part of these terms, please do not use our application.</p>

            <p>These Terms of Use serve as a custom End User License Agreement (EULA) between you and TaskStack.</p>

            <h2>Definitions</h2>

            <p>For the purposes of these Terms of Use:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>"App"</strong> or <strong>"TaskStack"</strong> refers to the TaskStack mobile application.
                </li>
                <li><strong>"We"</strong>, <strong>"Us"</strong>, or <strong>"Our"</strong> refers to the owner and
                    operator of TaskStack.</li>
                <li><strong>"You"</strong> or <strong>"Your"</strong> refers to the individual accessing or using the
                    App.</li>
                <li><strong>"Terms"</strong> refers to these Terms of Use.</li>
                <li><strong>"User Content"</strong> refers to tasks, habits, notes, and other information created and
                    stored by you when using the App.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>App Usage</h2>

            <p>TaskStack provides a platform for tracking and managing your habits and tasks. When using our
                application, you agree to:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Use the app for its intended purpose</li>
                <li>Provide accurate information when setting up your account or tasks</li>
                <li>Take responsibility for maintaining the security of your device</li>
                <li>Not attempt to gain unauthorized access to any part of the service</li>
                <li>Not use the app for any illegal or unauthorized purpose</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the TaskStack app for your
                personal, non-commercial use in accordance with these Terms.</p>

            <h2>User Content</h2>

            <p>When using TaskStack, you may create and store content such as tasks, habits, notes, and other
                information ("User Content"). You retain full ownership of your User Content. We do not claim any
                ownership rights to your User Content.</p>

            <p>Since TaskStack primarily stores data locally on your device, your User Content generally remains on your
                device. If you enable any backup or cloud sync features (if available), you grant us the right to store
                and process your User Content to provide those features.</p>

            <h2>External Content and Links</h2>

            <p>While TaskStack may provide access to certain external documents like privacy policies, we are not
                responsible for any external content that may be accessed through the app. We do not endorse any
                external
                websites, services, or content that may be accessed, intentionally or unintentionally, through the app.
            </p>

            <p>You agree that we bear no responsibility or liability for any damage or loss resulting from your use of
                external websites, content, or services accessed through the app.</p>

            <h2>Device Compatibility and Performance</h2>

            <p>While we strive to make TaskStack compatible with many devices, we cannot guarantee that the app will
                function optimally on all hardware configurations or operating system versions. The app's performance
                may
                vary based on your device's specifications, available storage, memory, other running applications, and
                operating system version.</p>

            <p>You acknowledge that using any software application may impact device performance, battery life, data
                usage,
                and storage capacity, and we are not responsible for any issues related to these hardware or system
                resource limitations.</p>

            <h2>Premium Features and Purchases</h2>

            <p>TaskStack offers optional premium features that can be accessed either through recurring subscriptions
                (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly) or a one-time purchase for lifetime access. By making any purchase:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>You agree to pay the specified price for the selected premium access</li>
                <li>You acknowledge that payments are processed through your app store account (Apple App Store or
                    Google Play)</li>
                <li>Refunds are handled according to the respective app store's refund policy</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Subscription Terms</h2>

            <p>The following terms apply specifically to auto-renewable subscriptions (e.g. weekly, monthly, yearly):
            </p>

            <p>Subscriptions purchased through an app store (like the Apple App Store or Google Play Store) are
                typically auto-renewable. This means your subscription will automatically renew unless auto-renew is
                turned off through your app store account settings at least 24 hours before the end of the current
                subscription period.</p>

            <p>Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period at the
                cost of the selected plan. You can manage or cancel your subscription and turn off auto-renewal by going
                to your respective app store account settings after purchase.</p>

            <p>All billing and transactions are handled by the respective app store (Apple App Store or Google Play
                Store) and are governed by their own terms and conditions. Any billing inquiries or refund requests must
                be directed to the appropriate app store.</p>

            <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>

            <p>TaskStack and its original content, features, and functionality are owned by us and are protected by
                applicable copyright and other intellectual property rights. You may not:</p>

                <li>Copy or replicate any part of our app for commercial purposes</li>

                    provisions of Google Play Terms of Service shall apply to the extent of the conflict.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>

            <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law:</p>

            <h2>Governing Law</h2>

            <h2>Waiver</h2>

            <p>No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right under these Terms will constitute a waiver of

                that right or any other rights under these Terms.</p>

            <h2>Severability</h2>

            <p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be changed

                applicable law, and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.</p>
